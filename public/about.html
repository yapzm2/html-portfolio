<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring Web Developer. My formal education was in Chemical Engineering and while I do find that subject 
  incredibly challenging and exciting, I have recently found interest in Web Development. I built this website to record
  and track my progress as I progress through Angela Yu's UDEMY course on Udemy. Thank you!
